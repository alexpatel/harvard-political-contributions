### Harvard Political Contributions

#### About

This repository contains data on the political contributions of Harvard faculty, administrators, and staff between 2001 and Election Day 2014. It is derived from FEC Individual Contribution [data disclosures](http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/ftpdet.shtml) over that time period. A subset of contributors who gave between 2011 and 2014 have been manually verified as Harvard employees, and data on the gender, school, and position of those contributors is provided. Analysis of the data can be found in analysis.R. 

#### Data


#### Building From Source Data

For transparency's sake, I've included the R scripts that were used to parse and merge the raw FEC individual contribution files and filter them by Harvard employee.
